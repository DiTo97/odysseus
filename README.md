# ESBDQN: E-scooter Smart Balancing DQN

This repo is the JAX implementation based on DeepMind's [DQN library](https://github.com/deepmind/dqn_zoo) of our WOA 2021 paper on ["Smart Balancing of E-scooter Sharing Systems via Deep Reinforcement Learning"](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2963/paper16.pdf), developed by Federico Minutoli, Gianvito Losapio, Viviana Mascardi, and Angelo Ferrando at the University of Genoa.

**Please note:** This repo uses a custom version of the [ODySSEUS simulator](https://odysseus-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) developed by the SmartData lab at PoliTO. More information on the changes we have made can be found in the paper.
